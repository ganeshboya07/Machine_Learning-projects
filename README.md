Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers based on similarities in their purchasing behavior and demographic data. This type of analysis helps businesses better understand their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies.

Using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, the project involves:
	•	Data preprocessing and visualization
	•	Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
	•	Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers
	•	Visualizing the resulting customer clusters for insights

This project demonstrates the practical application of unsupervised machine learning in the real-world business scenario of market segmentation.
